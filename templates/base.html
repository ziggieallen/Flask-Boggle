    <!--I had been stumped on why the page was still refreshing
    for hours and all I did was switch out where I had the table and the form 
    and now it suddenly works. None of the functions in the js file
    were even working until I just switched a few positions.  How??? -->
    <!-- On second thought, while I was changing the positions, I also added
    the section with ID "boggle". Could that have been what made it work? Maybe the 
    last line in my js file wasn't calling anything because "boggle" didn't exist? -->
